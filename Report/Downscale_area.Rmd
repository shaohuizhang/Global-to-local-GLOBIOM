# STEP X: Downscaling area information to SIMU
before downscaling:
- make sure that cropland >= crop area, if not take land from other agricultural land.
- Find information on fallow land, if so have to create a fallow land coefficient that assumes a share of cropland is fallow
- Find information on cropping intensity (double cropping) and adjust area

On priors:
- Note that a small prior results in the allocation of very small shares of crop land, which is not desirable.
- better to cut of priors arguing that if yield or transport costs are < X they are set to zero.

Solving model
- Check if there are infeasability issues with solving - will be clear in LOG

Dealing with different systems (intensification as in SPAM)
- Either just allocate crops without making any assumptions on the system. This means that in fact the systems distribution that are in GLOBIOM are used in the end. This takes area from the downscaling, production from FAOSTAT and relative yields per system from EPIC. All yields are scaled so that production FAOSTAT/area downscaling = yield.
- Already incorporate information on irrigated areas in the downscaling and use SPAM to distribute the three rainfed systems => this will replace the distribution of systems from SPAM.


Postprocessing:
- If crop area < cropcover, excess cropland needs to be distributed to other natural land as cropland needs to be equal to crop cover in GLOBIOM.
- Other option is to assume that excess crop cover is allocated to a crop that is not in the system and is therefore fixed (not recommended)

Livestock
- Check livestock map by ILRI and compare with land cover. Probably no need to adjust.
- 


QUESTIONS LIANG
Aim is to be able to create land use maps using SPAM but with flexibility to add data from stakeholders and for multiple years. 
- Multiple years
- Try to validate maps with LSMS-ISA data => case study data
- Try to allocate livestock to grassland.


Questions:
- How to deal with missing data. Understand that if one only has adm1 data, eq 12 holds only for adm1 for that crop. 
- But what about if there is no data at all for a crop at adm1 level? For instance data for MWI at adm1 (from CountryStat) only covers a few crops. Not banana. Banana is mapped in SPAM in MWI, probably from FAOSTAT. How?
- How to deal with subnational cropstatistics that only cover core crops. Downscale other crops from national level downwards?
- How to deal with border issues => center rule?

Next steps
- co-author on paper, perhaps using new techniques with case study for one country?


Questions on downscaling
- What is scalelp? Something is scaled with exogenous variable. Why?
- Difference main crops and crops with technology identifier?
- Why is suitability turned into a bound (not an equation)?
- produ(j) is crop land cover per j and l, right?
- what is deptot (ratio per main crop)? From eq 12 (subcrop), it should be total area of crop j in admk but description says 'ratio' 
- Why the name production of crops? This is in fact total physical area for crop j, right. 
- When subnational data is available, slack is minimized not entropy....
